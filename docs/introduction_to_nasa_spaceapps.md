## Nature and Purpose of the Challenge

The NASA International Space Apps Challenge (often just “Space Apps”) is an annual global hackathon initiated and organized by NASA, in collaboration with international space agency partners.

Its core purpose is to bring together a diverse set of participants (including coders, scientists, designers, technologists, storytellers, makers) to use **open data** from NASA and other space/agencies to address real-world problems on Earth *and* in space.

One of the distinguishing features is that the data is openly available; participants can leverage satellite imagery, Earth observation data, space mission data, and other datasets that NASA publishes. The challenge encourages interdisciplinary solutions; not just software, but visualizations, artistic interpretations, hardware prototypes, educational tools, etc.

## Event Process and Workflow

The event typically runs over two days (a weekend).

Here is what the flow generally looks like:

1. **Challenge Launch**
   At the start, NASA publishes a set of challenge statements (themes or specific problem statements). These are prepared by subject matter experts. Teams choose which challenge(s) they want to tackle.

2. **Team Formation / Ideation**
   Participants form teams (some come in with teams, others join during the event). People brainstorm ideas, select a specific problem to work on, and plan the approach.

3. **Research & Design**
   Once the idea is picked, there is usually a phase of exploring relevant data sets, doing sketches/mockups/design, defining what the solution will look like (UI, workflow, backend, etc.).

4. **Implementation / Build**
   This is where coding, prototyping, or building happens. Depending on the project, it could be web/mobile/dashboards, data processing, visualization, even hardware or sensor work if relevant.

5. **Testing & Refinement**
   Time permitting, teams try to polish the solution: debug, refine design/UI, ensure data is accurate, tweak based on feedback.

6. **Presentation / Submission**
   Teams prepare a demo or pitch, often with slides or a video, then submit their project. Local judging happens, and then some projects are selected for global judging. Awards or recognition are given locally and globally.

## Expectations for Engagement

* **Fast‐paced work**: The two-day timeframe means things move quickly. You’ll need to make decisions fast, avoid overambitious scope, and be ready to pivot.

* **Uncertainty in requirements/data**: Sometimes you’ll discover the data you need doesn’t exist, is messy, or not easy to process. Plan for some unknowns.

* **Collaboration and diversity**: Because teams often contain people from different backgrounds (tech, design, domain knowledge), good communication is essential. Sharing tasks, using each person’s strength, is key.

* **Learning curve**: Not everyone will know all the tools, APIs, or data formats. Expect to learn new things under pressure.

* **Judging criteria include impact, creativity, feasibility**: You will likely be evaluated not just on technical sophistication, but on how relevant/useful the solution is, how well you communicate it, how creative or novel the idea is, and how much can you show in the time available.

* **Deliverables may vary**: Depending on your team’s skills and resources, your project may range from a mockup or prototype to a working minimal app. Having something to show (even if not perfect) is more important than having something “complete but buggy.”

* **Exposure & opportunities**: If your project is good, you may get recognition locally and globally. There might be follow-up opportunities (continuing work, partnerships, mentors). Also exposure helps your resume or portfolio.
